# FreshSearch PLUGINS!

In this Branch of the repo, you can Upload custom plugins for FreshSearch Navigator!

## How this works!?:

This feature still's under development and we are trying to improve the experience of using Plugins in the Navigator!

## How to create a Plugin!:
It's more simple than you think, you will need to have the next things on your computer:
 - NodeJS
 - ElectronJS
 - FreshSearch API (It's just an IDEA!, but we are thinking about it!)
 - Bootstrap or Bootswatch
 - Plugin Base Code (You can download it here => https://bit.ly/3icQtVy)
